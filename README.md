## Horiseon: Refactoring an exisiting code

## Purpose
Refactor an exisiting code that uses html, a linked css stylesheet, and multiple images. The refactoring improved the code so that it follows accessibility guidelines and presents a more organized and cleaner code. The refactored code is now easier to read and contains fewer redundancies in classes and styling.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
